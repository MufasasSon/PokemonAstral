1.4.3.	☐  Spectral (phase-shift) 
1.4.3.1.	S: astral/magnet (they can pass through space and metal, disrupting physical and gravitational forces)

1.4.4.	☐  Magnetic (magnets/electromagnets) 
1.4.4.1.	S: chrono/spectral (time and ghosts are affected by magnetic fields and can be trapped or hindered by electromagnetic pulses)
1.4.4.2.	W: primal/astral (raw natural forces or cosmic powers can overpower magnetic manipulation)
1.4.5.	☐  Primal (Pure nature/elemental) 
1.4.5.1.	S: spectral/magnet (natural forces can overpower ethereal or electromagnetic entities)
1.4.5.2.	W: astral/chrono (time and cosmic forces disrupt primal energies, rendering them less effective)
1.4.6.	☐  Lumen (light/energy) 
1.4.6.1.	S: spectral/magnet (light pierces through shadows, and electromagnetic fields are disrupted by intense energy)

Step 1: Conceptualizing Your Game
•	Choose Your Game's Region and Story:
o	Develop a unique region with its own culture, geography, and challenges.
o	Think about the plot. Is it traditional or does it introduce something new (e.g., darker themes, new objectives)?
o	Checkbox: Create an outline for your region and story.
•	New Pokémon or Regional Variants:
o	Will you design new Pokémon species or create regional forms for existing ones?
o	Design your own Pokémon with their typing, abilities, stats, and moves.
Step 2: Choose Your Tools
•	Pokémon Essentials (for RPG Maker XP):
o	Pokémon Essentials is the most popular fan game creation tool, offering everything you need to create a game from scratch (map editing, sprite creation, etc.).
o	Tutorial: Pokémon Essentials Guide
o	Checkbox: Install Pokémon Essentials and RPG Maker XP.
•	ROM Hacking (for modifying existing games):
o	You can hack existing Pokémon games (like FireRed, Emerald, or Ruby) to create a new story, new Pokémon, and other modifications.
o	Tools: AdvanceMap for map editing, Lunar IPS for patching ROMs.
o	Checkbox: Download tools for ROM hacking (e.g., AdvanceMap, Lunar IPS).
Step 3: Designing Your Game
•	Maps and Towns:
o	Design your region’s map using the mapping tools available in Pokémon Essentials or the ROM hacking tools.
o	Think about how towns, cities, and routes will flow, how you’ll introduce gyms or other challenges.
o	Checkbox: Sketch out the map of your region and locations of towns and cities.
•	Script Your Story and Dialogue:
o	Create the dialogue for key story moments, including interactions with NPCs, the player’s rival, gym leaders, and the villainous team.
o	Checkbox: Write scripts for key events and interactions in the game.
Step 4: Designing Pokémon
•	Sprites and Art:
o	Create custom sprites for your Pokémon using pixel art software like Aseprite or Photoshop.
o	For trainers, gym leaders, and characters, design custom sprites to fit your story.
o	Checkbox: Create sprites for at least 5 Pokémon (or variants) and key characters.
•	Moves, Stats, and Abilities:
o	Design the stats, movesets, and abilities for each Pokémon in your game.
o	Think about how new abilities or moves will affect battle strategy.
o	Checkbox: Define moves, stats, and abilities for at least 5 Pokémon.
Step 5: Programming Mechanics and Features
•	Battle System:
o	If you’re using Pokémon Essentials, the battle system is largely pre-set, but you can tweak it to suit your game. If you want a more custom system, you might need to code it.
o	Checkbox: Program basic battle mechanics (turn-based, stat changes, etc.).
•	New Mechanics and Features:
o	Want to add something unique? Examples include custom battle mechanics, region-specific mechanics (like Alola's regional forms or Mega Evolution).
o	Checkbox: Design at least one unique game mechanic (new battle system, evolutions, etc.).
Step 6: Testing and Debugging
•	Playtesting:
o	Play through the game multiple times to ensure everything is working as expected. This includes checking for broken events, bugs, and other issues.
o	Checkbox: Test the game for bugs, errors, and broken scripts.
•	User Feedback:
o	Share your progress with a small group of testers to get feedback on gameplay, story, and mechanics.
o	Checkbox: Get feedback from testers and make improvements.
Step 7: Polishing and Releasing
•	Final Graphics and Music:
o	Add finishing touches to your game’s graphics, including custom tilesets, environment effects, and background music.
o	Checkbox: Create or source music and final graphics for the game.
•	Launch Your Game:
o	Once you’ve polished everything, it’s time to release your game! You can host it on fan game websites or share it through a download link.
o	Checkbox: Prepare the final version for release (documentation, patching).
